        ui-name : |
            Reads Associated with RNASeq Sample
        short-hint : |
            Select the reads associated with RNASeq sample

            Indexed Genome
        short-hint : |
            Specify the indexed genome built using bowtie2
    reference :
        ui-name : |
            Genome
        short-hint : |
            Specify the name of genome
    output_obj_name :
        ui-name : |
            Alignment Output
        short-hint : |
            Provide the name of bowtie2 read alignment output
    alignment_type :
        ui-name : |
            Alignment Type
        short-hint : |
            Select the alignment type
        long-hint : |
            By default, bowtie2 performs end-to-end read alignment. It searches for alignments involving all of read characters. For local option, it can clip some read characters from one or both ends of the alignment to maximize the alignment score.
    quality_score :
        ui-name : |
            Alignment Quality Score Type
        short-hint : |
            Select the quality score type
        long-hint : |
            phred+33 used by the latest illumina
    preset_options :
        ui-name : |
            Alignment Type Preset Options
        short-hint : |
            Select the preset options based on alignment type
        long-hint : |
            The presets ending in fast generally being faster but less sensitive and less accurate, and the presets ending in sensitive generally being slower but more sensitive and more accurate.

description : |
    <p>This method allows to align the sequencing reads to long reference sequences using bowtie2. It takes a bowtie2 index object and sequencing read file and outputs a set of alignments in SAM format.</p> 
    <p>Bowtie2 supports gapped, local and paired-end alignment modes. By default, Bowtie 2 performs end-to-end read alignment. That is, it searches for alignments involving all of the read characters. This is also called an "untrimmed" or "unclipped" alignment. It also supports a "local" alignment mode, which does not require that reads align end-to-end.This produces alignments that might be "trimmed" (or "soft clipped") at one or both extremes in a way that optimizes alignment score.</p>
