    <p>This method allows aligning RNA-seq reads to an eukaryotic genome using Tophat in order to identify exon-exon splice junctions using bowtie mapping program.</p>
    <p>This method takes a bowtie2 index object and sequencing read file and outputs a set of read alignments in SAM format.</p>
    <p> In addition, it provides the alignment statistics (total reads, mapped and unmapped reads, singletons, multiple alignments, and alignment rate in table format.</p>
