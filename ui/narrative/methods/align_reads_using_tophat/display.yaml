description : |
    <p>This method aligns the RNA-seq reads from a sample to an eukaryotic genome using TopHat in order to identify splice junctions between exons with the help of Bowtie2 mapping program.</p>
    <p>This method takes a Bowtie2 index object and sequencing read file and outputs a set of read alignments in BAM format.</p>
    <p>In addition, it provides the alignment statistics such as total reads, mapped and unmapped reads, singletons, multiple alignments, and alignment rate in a table format.</p>
    
    <p><strong>WARNING:</strong> This method is one of the steps of the <a href= "http://kbase.us/rna-seq/"> KBase RNA-seq Pipeline </a> and is not intended to run standalone.</p>
