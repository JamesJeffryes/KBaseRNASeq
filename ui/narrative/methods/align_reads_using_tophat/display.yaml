    read_mismatches :
        ui-name : |
            Mismatches in Reads
        short-hint : |
            Final read alignments having more than these mismatches are discarded.The default is 2.
    read_gap_length :
        ui-name : |
            Gap length in reads
        short-hint : |
            Final read alignments having more than these many total length of gaps are discarded.The default is 2.

        short-hint : |
            Final read alignments having more than these many edit distance are discarded.The default is 2.

        ui-name : |
            Minimum intron length
        short-hint : |
            Tophat will ignore donor/acceptor pairs closer than this many bases apart. The default is 70.

    <p>This method allows aligning RNASeq reads to a genome using Tophat in order to identify exon-exon splice junctions using bowtie mapping program. 
</p>
   <p>This method takes a bowtie2 index object and sequencing read file and outputs a set of read alignments in SAM format. It also provides A UCSC BED track of junctions and UCSC BED tracks of insertions and deletions as output files.</p>
