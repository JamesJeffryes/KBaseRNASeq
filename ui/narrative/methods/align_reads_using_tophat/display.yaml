description : |
    <p>This method aligns the RNA-seq reads to an eukaryotic genome using Tophat in order to identify splice junctions between exons with the help of Bowtie2 mapping program.</p>
    <p>This method takes a Bowtie2 index object and sequencing read file and outputs a set of read alignments in BAM format.</p>
    <p>In addition, it provides the alignment statistics such as total reads, mapped and unmapped reads, singletons, multiple alignments, and alignment rate in a table format.</p>
    
    <p><strong>NOTE:</strong>This method currently does not support batch processing of all the read samples. Therefore, this method must be run individually for each of the RNA-seq samples. Please stay tuned for the batch version of this method that will be available in near future.</p>
