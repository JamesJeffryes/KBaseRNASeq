    <p>This method allows to assemble transcripts, estimate their abundances using cufflinks.</p>
    <p>It accepts aligned RNASeq reads from bowtie2 or tophat and assembles the alignments into a parsimonious set of transcripts. It then estimates the relative abundances of these transcripts based on how many reads support each one, taking into account biases in library preparation protocols.</p>
