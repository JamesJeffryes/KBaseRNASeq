parameters :
  alignmentset_id :
    ui-name : |
        RNA-seq Alignment or Alignment Set 
    short-hint : |
        Select the RNA-seq alignment or alignment set created by Bowtie2 or TopHat.
  num-threads :
    ui-name : |
      Number of  Threads
    short-hint : |
      Number of computational threads to assemble transcriptomes. The default is 1.
  label :
    ui-name : |
      label
    short-hint : |
      Sets label as the prefix for the name of the output transcripts
  min_isoform_abundance :
    ui-name : |
      Minimum Isoform Abundance
    short-hint : |
      Sets the minimum isoform abundance of the predicted transcripts as a fraction of the most abundant transcript assembled at a given locus. Lower abundance transcripts are often artifacts of incompletely spliced precursors of processed transcripts. Default: 0.1. 
  a_juncs :
    ui-name : |
      Filter Junctions with no splice reads with the number of given bases
    short-hint : |
      Junctions that don't have spliced reads that align across them with at least this amount of bases on both sides are filtered out. Default: 10
  min_length :
    ui-name : |
      Minimum Length for Predicted Transcripts
    short-hint : |      
      Minimum Length for Predicted Transcripts.Default: 200
  j_min_reads :
    ui-name : |
      Minimum Spliced Reads to align across a Junction
    short-hint : |
      Minimum Spliced Reads to align across a Junction.Default: 1
  c_min_read_coverage :
    ui-name : |
      Minimum Read Coverage Allowed for Predicted Transcripts
    short-hint : |
      Minimum Read Coverage Allowed for Predicted Transcripts.Default: 2.5
  gap_sep_value :
    ui-name : |
      Minimum locus Gap Separation Value.
    short-hint : |
      Minimum locus Gap Separation Value.Default:50
  disable_trimming :
    ui-name : |
      Disable Trimming at the ends of the assembled transcripts
    short-hint : |
      Disable Trimming at the ends of the assembled transcripts
  ballgown_mode :
    ui-name : |
      Enable Ballgown Input table files
    short-hint : |
      With this option StringTie can be used as a direct replacement of the tablemaker program included with the Ballgown distribution. 
  skip_reads_with_no_ref :
    ui-name : |
      Skip Reads with no Reference Transcript
    short-hint : |
      Skip Reads with no Reference Transcript.
  merge :
    ui-name : |
      Transcript merge mode
    short-hint : |
      Transcript merge mode.                                                    
    
description : |
    <p>This method assembles transcripts for a given sample or a sample set using Cufflinks so that you can view the relative abundances of the assembled transcripts in a histogram, obtained as output from Cufflinks. </p>
    <p>It accepts aligned RNA-seq reads from Bowtie2 or TopHat and assembles the alignments into a parsimonious set of transcripts. It then estimates the relative abundances of these transcripts based on how many reads support each one, taking into account biases in library preparation protocols.</p>
    <p>The Cufflinks output object contains GTF and FPKM files. The GTF file contains annotated transcripts assembled by Cufflinks whereas the FPKM file gives the normalized abundance of each transcript expressed in fragments per kilobase of exon per million fragments mapped (FPKM). The Cuffdiff Table Histogram tab displays the abundance of normalized gene expression value log2(FPKM+1).</p>
