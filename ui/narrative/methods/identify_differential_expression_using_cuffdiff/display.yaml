parameters :
  rnaseq_exp_details :
    ui-name : |
      RNASeq Experiment Name
    short-hint : |
      Specify the RNASeq Experiment Name
  output_obj_name :
    ui-name : |
      Cuffdiff output
    short-hint : |
      Provide the name of cuffdiff output
  num-threads :
    ui-name : |
      Number of  threads
    short-hint : |
      Number of  threads to align reads. The default is 1.
  min-alignment-count :
    ui-name : |
      Minimum Count of Alignment
    short-hint : |
      Minimum number of alignments in a locus to conduct significant changes in the locus between samples. The default is 10. 
  time-series :
    ui-name : |
      Time Series
    short-hint : |
       Analyze the provided samples as a time series, rather than testing for differences between all pairs of samples. 
  multi-read-correct :
    ui-name : |
      Multi Read Correct
    short-hint : |
      To provide more accurately weight reads mapping to multiple locations in the genome. 
  labels  :
    ui-name : |
      Condition Labels
    short-hint : |
      Specify a label for each sample which will be included in various cuffdiff output files.
  library-type  :
    ui-name : |
      Library Types
    short-hint : |
      Select the library type.
  library-norm-method :
    ui-name : |
      Library Normalization Method
    short-hint : |
      Select the library normalization method.

description : |
    <p>This method is used to find significant changes in transcript expression using cuffdiff.</p>
    <p>It accepts GTF annotation file produced by cuffmerge and SAM files of aligned RNAseq reads as input. If more than two SAM files are provided, cuffdiff tests for differential expression between all pairs of samples.</p>
    <p>Cuffdiff calculates the FPKM of each transcript, primary transcript and gene in each sample and produces differentially expressed files.</p>
